There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you came to see
It's you who's taunting me
Because you're wanting me
To be the stranger in the night
Am I amusing you
Or just confusing me
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you wanna see
Eccentric oddities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is it scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby
There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin' inlay open
Where a restless soul is pokin'
I'm gonna be exactly what you wanna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
So tell me
Is that scary for you, baby
Tell me, so tell me
Is that realism for you, baby
Am I scary for you baby
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you
Masquerade the heart
To hide the hurting soul
Just not what you see of me
Can hardly reveal the proof
Like the mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
